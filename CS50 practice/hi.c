//when "c" are changed to i it shows the numerical code for the words BTS//
//strings are sequency of characters, strings in molecular form are arrays but they dont need the user to tell how many charcters are in there//
//strings identify where the chars/arrays end by identifying the empty that 0's in it, which is represented by \0 cause putting just "0" can be confusing//
//nul means the end 0's that terminates strings//
